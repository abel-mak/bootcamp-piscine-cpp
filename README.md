## C++ class object
- An object of a C++ class is represented by a contiguous region of memory. A pointer to an object of a class points to the first byte of that region of memory. The compiler turns a call of a member function into an "ordinary'function call with an "extra' argument, that "extra' argument is a pointer to the object for
which the member function is called.[src](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/compsystems/1989/fall_stroustrup.pdf)
```
class A
{
  int a;
  void f(int i);
};
```
